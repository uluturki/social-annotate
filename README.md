# twitter_annotate
Helps annotating twitter users by bringin everything in a single screen and keeping records straight.



# Brain storming for the tool

We can consider having a tool to help reseachers to annotate and collect data easily on their browser. [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twlets-twitter-to-excel/glmadnnfibhnhgboophnodnhbjdogiec) is an example designe to download data. We can do better and add annotation capabilities.

Some design choices can be

- Easy to customize interface for specific tasks. People can design their own study in two levels: Account and content level. 

- Easy to export outcomes. We can provide settings for researchers to select their data collection. User profile metadata and content information can be collected. Data storage can be either a server or browser storage that will give a chance to export as json or CSV file.
